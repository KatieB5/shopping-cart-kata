# Shopping Cart Kata

## Introduction
This kata is a shopping cart checkout system. There are several products available, each with a price per unit. Some products have a special offer price when bought in certain quantities e.g., 4 for 120. The checkout system consumes an array of objects as a data source e.g.,[{"code":"A","quantity":3},{"code":"B","quantity":3},{"code":"C","quantity":1},{"code":"D","quantity":2}], and returns the sub total when queried.
